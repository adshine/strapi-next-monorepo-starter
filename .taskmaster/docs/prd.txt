### Backend Development
- Create Strapi collections: Project, Plan, UserProfile, DownloadLog, TemplateRequest, SubscriptionEvent
- Implement authentication system with email verification and password reset
- Build quota management with row-level locking and atomic operations
- Create download system with R2 signed URLs and retry logic
- Integrate Stripe webhook handling and subscription lifecycle management
- Develop API endpoints following spec contracts

### Edge Worker Implementation
- Build Cloudflare Worker for API gateway
- Implement session validation and CSRF protection
- Add rate limiting per route with specific thresholds
- Create caching layer for public endpoints
- Configure request proxying and response optimization

### Frontend Development

- Create pricing page with plan comparison and checkout flow
- Implement account dashboard with subscription and quota displays
- Develop authentication pages (login, register, verify, reset)
- Build download modal with quota checking and progress tracking
- Create template request submission and tracking system

### Testing & Quality
- Write unit tests for Strapi services (80% coverage)
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Build E2E tests for critical user paths with Playwright
- Perform load testing with concurrent users
- Conduct security testing for vulnerabilities

### Production Readiness
- Configure production environment variables
- Prepare database migrations and seed data
- Create deployment runbooks and documentation
- Set up monitoring alerts and backup procedures
- Implement legal compliance (Terms, Privacy, GDPR)

## Technical Specifications

### Authentication Flow
