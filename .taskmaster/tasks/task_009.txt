# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Quota Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement plan-based monthly remix quotas with row-level locking and atomic operations.
# Details:
Add quota fields to UserProfile and Plan. Use DB transactions and row-level locks to enforce limits. Reset quotas at UTC midnight monthly.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate concurrent remixes, verify correct quota enforcement and reset.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Quota Data Model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement database schema changes to support plan-based monthly remix quotas, including fields for quota limits and usage in UserProfile and Plan tables.
### Details:
Add integer fields for monthly quota limits and current usage to UserProfile and Plan models. Ensure schema supports atomic updates and row-level locking. Document schema changes and update relevant ORM models.

## 2. Implement Quota Enforcement Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop backend logic to check and enforce quota limits during remix requests using database transactions and row-level locks.
### Details:
On each remix request, start a DB transaction, acquire a row-level lock on the user's quota record, check if the quota allows the remix, and atomically increment usage if permitted. Return appropriate errors if quota is exceeded.

## 3. Integrate Plan-Based Quota Assignment [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Ensure that quota limits are assigned and updated based on the user's subscription plan, including handling plan changes and upgrades.
### Details:
On plan assignment or change, update the user's quota limit field to match the new plan's quota. Handle edge cases such as downgrades, upgrades, and add-ons. Sync with subscription lifecycle events.

## 4. Implement Monthly Quota Reset Job [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a scheduled job to reset all users' quota usage counters at UTC midnight on the first of each month.
### Details:
Implement a cron or scheduled task that runs at UTC midnight, acquires row-level locks on affected records, and resets usage counters to zero. Ensure atomicity and log resets for audit purposes.

## 5. Build Quota Usage Reporting and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Develop reporting endpoints and monitoring tools to track quota usage, enforcement actions, and reset events for users and plans.
### Details:
Expose API endpoints for querying current quota usage and limits. Implement dashboards or logs for monitoring quota enforcement and reset activities. Alert on anomalies or failures.
