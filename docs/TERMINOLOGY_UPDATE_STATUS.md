# Terminology Update Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-22

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The "download → remix" terminology migration is complete across both frontend and backend. UI copy, documentation, APIs, and database schema now use "remix" (or "template access") terminology to reflect how Framer templates are duplicated rather than downloaded. The legacy download schemas have been migrated and removed.

## Summary

All user-facing copy, documentation, and UI components now use "remix" terminology instead of "download" to accurately reflect how Framer templates work (they are remixed/duplicated in user's Framer account, not downloaded as files).

## What Was Updated ✅

### 1. Frontend Components (COMPLETED)

- `download-modal.tsx` → `remix-modal.tsx` - Component renamed and all text updated
- All imports updated to use RemixModal
- Button text changed from "Download" to "Remix"
- Modal headers and content updated

### 2. Page Files (COMPLETED)

- templates/page.tsx - Updated to use remix terminology
- dashboard/favorites/page.tsx - Updated imports and terminology

### 3. Middleware & Routes (COMPLETED)

- middleware.ts - Changed `/download/.*` to `/remix/.*`

### 4. TypeScript Types (COMPLETED)

- templates.ts - Updated with remixCount and dailyRemixes (with TODO comments)
- auth.ts - Already had remix fields with TODO comments

### 5. Hooks (COMPLETED)

- use-user-profile.ts - Updated to use remix terminology with TODO comments

### 6. Seeder Files (COMPLETED)

- plans.js - Updated plan features to use "template remixes"

## Backend Migration Summary

- All Strapi collections and fields have been renamed (e.g., `download_logs` → `template_access_logs`, `download_url` → `remix_url`, `download_lock_version` → `remix_lock_version`).
- New `/api/template-access-logs` endpoint is active; legacy `/api/download-logs` has been removed.
- Lifecycle hooks, services, controllers, and migrations now use remix terminology.
- Frontend helpers and API clients were updated to the new endpoints; only historical notes remain in documentation for reference.

## Final Migration Completion (2025-09-22)

### Backend Schema Migration

- ✅ Database migration script executed successfully (`rename-download-to-remix.js`)
- ✅ Strapi types regenerated with new field names
- ✅ Backend starts successfully with migrated schema
- ✅ User profile fields renamed: `monthlyRemixesLimit`, `monthlyRemixesUsed`, `totalRemixes`

### Frontend Field Alignment

- ✅ API routes updated to use correct field names (`monthlyRemixesLimit`, `monthlyRemixesUsed`, `totalRemixes`)
- ✅ UI components updated (remix-modal.tsx, dashboard/page.tsx)
- ✅ Hooks cleaned up - removed stale TODO comments (use-user-profile.ts)
- ✅ All field names now match Strapi schema exactly

### Verification Complete

- ✅ Lint passes with no migration-related warnings
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ Strapi starts and runs with migrated schema
- ✅ TypeScript types are consistent across frontend and backend

## Migration Strategy

All frontend code has been updated to use the new terminology. Backend field names are preserved to avoid breaking changes, with TODO comments indicating future renames. This approach ensures:

1. **No breaking changes** - Backend API remains compatible
2. **Clear migration path** - TODOs document what needs to be renamed
3. **Consistent UX** - Users see consistent "remix" terminology throughout

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Frontend UI components use "remix" terminology
- [x] Component files renamed appropriately
- [x] Imports and exports updated
- [x] TypeScript types updated with TODO comments
- [x] Hooks updated with new field names
- [x] Routes updated from /download to /remix
- [x] Documentation files updated (cloudflare-setup.md, platform-ui-design.md, platform-user-flows.md)
- [x] Backend schema migrated (collections/fields/endpoints renamed)
- [x] terminology-update-guide.md updated with completion notes
- [x] Build and test verification completed successfully

## Next Steps (Future)

When ready for backend migration:

1. Create new Strapi migrations to rename collections and fields
2. Update API endpoints
3. Remove TODO comments from frontend code
4. Update TypeScript generated types

## Notes

- The term "remix" better reflects the actual user action (duplicating a template in Framer)
- "Download" implied file downloads, which was inaccurate
- This change improves user understanding and reduces confusion
